    "# Static Visualizations in Python\n",
    "### by [Jason DeBacker](http://jasondebacker.com), September 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will walk you through examples of plots using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) in Python.  We'll cover the types of plots commonly used in economics applications: line and bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and whisker plots.  We'll also look at representing geospatial data on shaded maps and plotting kernel densities of distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an application, we'll look at Chetty, Friedman, and Hendren's (and others') [Opportunity Insights Project](https://opportunityinsights.org).  This project, from which there are a series of [papers](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/) seeks to document and understand variation in economic, health, and other outcomes across geography and time in the United States.  To do this, the project contributors have utilized adiministrative data from a number of sources, along with survey data, to consider childhood exposure to various factors and link that to adult outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There website that hosts this project has a number of different datasets available for other researchers.  We'll use data from [\"Where is the Land of Opportunity? The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United States\"](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/chetty-friedman-kline-saezQJE14mobility.pdf) by  Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez (*Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 2014).  Specifically, we'll download the Excel workbook with the online data tables [here](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/).\n",

    "## Line Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major contributions of this project is a transition matrix that gives the nation-wide probability of a child moving to another point in the income distribution than her parents.  The transitions in this matrix are thus inter-generational.  They tell us the probability of a child born in 1980-82 moving from a household with parents at a certain percentile in the distribution of family income to another percentile as an adult (family income of the child is measured in 2011-2012, when the child is not approximately 30 years old).  \n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of mobility is what is called the \"immobility rate\" or \"staying probability\". This is simply the average of the diagonal elements of the transition matrix.  To see how mobility varies over the distribution of family income, let's plot the staying probabilities at each percentile in the distribution of family income."
